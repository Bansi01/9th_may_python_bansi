# How memory is managed in python?

Memory is management in Python in one of two ways:
dynamic allocation or static allocation.
Dynamic allocation occurs as the program is running. This means that as the program operates, it can dynamically determine where to allocate memory while reusing and releasing it. Static memory allocation happens before the running of a program, predetermining the amount and distribution of the memory, and without the ability to reuse memory.
