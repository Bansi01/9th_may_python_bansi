1. What is  software?
-> Software is the set of instructions,data or programs used to operate computers and execute spectific tasks. 
-> Opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of the computer.
-> Software is a genetic term used to refer to applications,scripts and programs that run on a device.
->It can be thought of as the variable part of the computer.
-> Two main categories of software :
    System ~ Application Software1
    ~ Software
-> Application Software : Software that fulfills a specific need and performs task.
-> System Software :  Software is designed to run a computer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run on top of..


2. What are the types of Application?
-> Applications also referred to as apps are created to execute specific tasks on computers or mobile devices. It runs inside the operating system of the device used to open it. 
-> The following are the different types of applications based on need:
   ~ Database apps: These software programs are created to retrieve, manage, and share information efficiently between multiple users. Database apps also have systems to organize and retrieve data seamlessly based on specific needs. 
   ~ Custom apps: Custom apps are application software designed specifically for a user or group of users within an organization to help them accomplish their specific tasks. It ensures that you can create a tailored experience for each team or each member of a team. 
   ~ Web-based apps: Web apps are application software accessible online through a browser. It behaves like a mobile app when it’s accessed with a browser from a mobile device, but it can also be accessed on any internet-connected device, including a desktop, PC, or tablet. The web app frontend is created with languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which are supported by most browsers.
   ~ Low code apps: Low-code apps are applications created with minimal code involved. These apps ensure that IT teams and business users can deliver fast digital solutions to solve specific business problems. The low-code application approach removes the need to write custom codes.
   ~ No code apps: No code apps are applications built without any complex coding skills. You can simply use graphical user interfaces to create the software instead of writing several lines of code. This removes the barrier to app creation and allows more people to build functional applications.  
   ~ Enterprise apps: Enterprise apps are applications that businesses use to solve problems within their organization. They’re designed to interface or integrate with other enterprise apps. Enterprise application development requires a high level of stability and reliability because they plug into core processes within an organization. A banking service app or inventory management application are examples of enterprise apps.

3. What is programming? 
-> A program is the set of instructions to be executed by the computer to accomplish a given task. The basic unit of program is data. Program is a computer solution to any problem. Based on the customer needs and requirement, the program could be designed accordingly. A program can be defined as either a set of written instructions created by a programmer or an executable piece of software. The term computer programming is defined as the "The series of steps involved in solving a problem of the computer". Generally, the language which computer can understand to solve the given problem are known as Programming Language.

4. What is Python?
-> Python is dynamic object oriented programming language, high level programming language. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
